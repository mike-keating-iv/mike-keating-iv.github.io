        <p>
        I hold a bachelor's degree in Polymer and Color Chemistry and a master's degree in 
        Industrial Engineering, both from North Carolina State University. Currently, I work 
        as an engineer in a mechanical testing lab, where I am passionate about lab automation 
        through scripting and data-driven solutions.
